There are several files in the directory, to compile my code, please do the following:

First of all, you should compile the "shell.c" first ---------> clang -o shell shell.c

Then, compile the rest of the file ----------> clang -o main main.c reader.c writer.c shared_memory.c

After doing the above steps, please do the following : 
./shell
./main

It will ask you to input the string, if you want to terminate it gracefully, you can type control + D. 

Make sure that these files are in the same directory.

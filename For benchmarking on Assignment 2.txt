For benchmarking on Assignment 2:

1)  Run the modified Minix Kernel
2)  Run "top" via SSH
3)  Run "spawn 1000" or simliar via /usr/benchmarks/unixbench/pgms
- Spawn will show a high CPU usage,
- Use whatever constant you want to stress the OS
4)  Generate kernel use statistics
- average over >=100 timer interrupts the number of processes running and priorities.
5)  Profile scheduler:
At each timer interrupt, see how many processes are at each priority level, average this information over some large number of interrupts (maybe 100), then print it out. Conclude something about the settings of the various parameters: are they too long, too short, just right. Justify your conclusions. 


Note:  To draw conclusions about the various parameters, you will need to adjust them multiple times.  

Hint:  You will need to investigate how the multilevel Minix scheduler works and how it differs from the lottery scheduler (a dynamic priority queue).

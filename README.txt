There is another file called "longrun.c" in the directory. I use this file to show the high usage of CPU.

There are two files in this directory called "proc.c" and "proc.h". In these two files, 
you can type "Lottery Scheduling" to find where I have modified. 

There are more details in my design document called "Design_Doc".

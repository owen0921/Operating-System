How to execute the program:
clang shell.c -o shell
./shell

Special case:
If you input "cd" without any argument or "cd ~", 
the program will change the directory to the $HOME (In my environment, it will change to "/root").

When you input "ls &", which has the symbol "&" at the end, the program will wait until you press the enter again.
